# Tic_tac_toe_Reinforcment_learning_agent
* ## Idea ![](https://github.com/Antanskas/Sentiment_analysis/blob/master/repository_images/idea.png)
  * To build tic-tac-toe game agents to be able to play and win tic tac toe game learning by playing thousands of games and getting rewards while winning.  
  
* ## Reinforcment learning  ![](https://github.com/Antanskas/Sentiment_analysis/blob/master/repository_images/model.png)
  * Q-learning
  
* ## Process ![](https://github.com/Antanskas/Sentiment_analysis/blob/master/repository_images/results.png)
  * Agents trained for 10000, 20000, 50000, 100000 episodes
  
* ## Policies ![](https://github.com/Antanskas/Sentiment_analysis/blob/master/repository_images/books.png)
  * Policies are saved as 'policy_player_1_(numberEpisodes)'
  
* ## Usabilities
  * To train: state.train()
  * To test: state.playRandom()
  * To play yourself agains trained agent: state.playHuman()
 
* ## Results
